* Problem to solve

Network Team needs software that can analyze firewall traffic log files

- files are quite large: 1 file = ~10GB zipped (150GB unzipped)
- copying files to other server takes time and disk space
- in most cases need to analyze 7 or 14 logs 
- restrictions for installing software on a log server

* Solutions

- Java 
*Args* *for*:     
- speed 

*Args* *against*: 
- I don't like Java much ;)
- need to install JVM on server

* Solutions

- Python
*Args* *for*: 
- simple solution

*Args* *against*:
- slow (version 2.6 available on server)

* Solutions

- Hadoop/Spark
*Args* *for*: 
-high speed

*Args* *against*: 
- solution available mainly for clients
- need to copy log files to other server

* Solutions

- Go
*Args* *for*:
- I wanted to learn it
- no need for installation anything on a server
- nice and clean language
- speed
*Args* *against*: 
- time to learn new language

My choice: *Go*

* Application flow

- authenticate using Active Directory
- get request data using HTML form
- validate data
- put request to a queue
- take request from a queue
- inform user (via email) about starting processing his data
- process file logs saving results in an in-memory SQLite DB
- save result to excel file
- send email with file attached

* Application - Demo

* What people say about Go at ING Services

- "What is Go? Is it some kind of programming language?"
- "I know what is go go but what is Go?"
- "Go and Scala will rule soon, GO Ahead"

* Future projects

Would I use Go for next projects?

* My thoughts on Go

- very nice language 
- has very good tools gofmt, goimport, go test, etc.
- you don't need heavy tools to use it

* My thoughts on Go

- Go forces you to think deeply about the problem you have to solve.
- Go forces you to know how does programming language works. In Python you can write couple lines of code and it magically works.
- Go is much more strict than Python.
- Go encourages you to write simple and clean code
All that makes your program less error prone, clean and more readable for others

* My thoughts on Go

- sometimes it seems to be a bit low level (similarities with C)
- lack of mature libraries (It will change over time)

* Learning Go

- small language
- quite easy to start
- Go is not Java or Python, folow Go way
- learn by doing
- use [[https://play.golang.org][paly.golang.org]
